-- I am analyzing a database containing information on superstore inventory data to draw important insights into item info.

-- Order the items by price (high to low)
SELECT item_name as 'Item Name', 
CONCAT('$', price) as 'Price (High to Low)' 
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Find the average price of all items in the Electronics category
SELECT CONCAT('$', ROUND(AVG(price), 2)) as 'Average Price of Electronics'
FROM superstore
WHERE category == 'Electronics';

-- Find the maximum price for the items in the Kitchen Supplies category
SELECT CONCAT('$', MAX(price)) as 'Maximum Price of Kitchen Supplies'
FROM superstore
WHERE category == 'Kitchen Supplies';

-- Show how many items are in each category
SELECT category as 'Category',
COUNT(category) as 'Number of Items'
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;
