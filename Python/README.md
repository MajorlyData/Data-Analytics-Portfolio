# Data Analytics - Python Portfolio

Welcome to the Python portion of my portfolio!

This folder contains examples of Python code I've researched, written and edited to gather, clean and analyze data in conjunction with tools such as SQL and Tableau.

## Important Tools Utilized
+ Anaconda
+ Jupyter Notebooks
+ Libraries:
    + Pandas
    + Matplotlib
    + Numpy
    + BeautifulSoup
    + Requests
    + CSV

## Highlighted Projects
+ [IMDB Web Scraping](https://github.com/MajorlyData/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/IMDB_Scraping.ipynb): In this project, I scraped the data of the top 250 movies on IMDB's website using the requests module to extract html information from the webpage itself, found here: https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/. I then used BeautifulSoup to parse through the data using Python's built in html parser and created a list of all 250 movies. Finally, I looped through each movie and assigned each value to a corresponding variable, then wrote each row of data to the csv file.
