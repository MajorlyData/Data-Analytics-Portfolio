# Data Analytics - Python Portfolio

Welcome to the Python portion of my portfolio!

This folder contains examples of Python code I've researched, written and edited to gather, clean and analyze data in conjunction with tools such as SQL and Tableau.

## Important Tools Utilized
+ Anaconda
+ Jupyter Notebooks
+ Libraries:
    + Pandas
    + Matplotlib
    + Seaborn
    + Numpy
    + BeautifulSoup
    + Requests
    + CSV

## Highlighted Projects
+ [IMDB Web Scraping](https://github.com/MajorlyData/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/IMDB_Scraping.ipynb): In this project, I scraped the data of the top 250 movies on IMDB's website using the requests module to extract html information from the webpage itself, found here: https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/. I then used BeautifulSoup to parse through the data using Python's built in html parser and created a list of all 250 movies. Finally, I looped through each movie and assigned each value to a corresponding variable, then wrote each row of data to a csv file.
+ [Games Sales Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/MajorlyData/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/Games_Sales_Analysis.ipynb): In this project, I utilized a dataset containing information related to sales of video games up to the year 2016 to perform ETL, Exploratory Data Analysis, Grouping and Aggregating Data and Visualizations on the dataset. I used important Python libraries within the Data Analytics sphere such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Numpy to finish these tasks. I read through the CSV, explored the data itself, analyzed the data, grouped and aggregated the data and finally visualized the data into charts and plots to answer questions about sales history, platform information and more.
+ [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/MajorlyData/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/Data%20Cleaning%20in%20Pandas.ipynb) and [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/MajorlyData/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20Pandas.ipynb) in Pandas: In this multi-part project, I used sample datasets to clean, explore and analyze important data and statistics. I used a multitude of Python utilizations to extract, transform and load the data to gather valuable insights and visualize key metrics within the dataset, such as looking at correlation graphs and plotting average population by continent. The information extracted from these datasets would be incredibly useful in providing potential insights into business, marketing and strategic decision making.
