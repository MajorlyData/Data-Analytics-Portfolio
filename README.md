## Highlighted Projects

+ **[Customer & Order Analytics](https://github.com/MajorlyData/SQL/blob/main/Customer%20%26%20Order%20Analytics):** I queried multiple instances of data from a database named Sales_DB to highlight a variety of real world observations, including showing the number of orders for a specific month, the types of orders placed and the amount of revenue made. I also utilized important SQL functions to answer vital questions about the data, such as using JOINs to connect two tables and extract overlapping information, using subqueries to check if values match each other and making use of aggregate functions to evaluate different points of interest, such as SUM and COUNT. Lastly, and importantly, I employed data cleanup to make sure the data I did extrapolate was correct and in good standing, specifically to filter out any orderID or Product that may have been entered incorrectly or have become corrupted by external factors.
